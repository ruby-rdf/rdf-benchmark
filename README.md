## Contributing

This repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.

* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
  Before committing, run `git diff --check` to make sure of this.
* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the
  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `.gemspec` or `VERSION` files. If you need to change them,
  do so on your private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the
  corresponding list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Don't touch the `AUTHORS` file. If your contributions are significant
  enough, be assured we will eventually add you in there.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an
  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you,
  which you will be asked to agree to on the first commit to a repo within the organization.
  Note that the agreement applies to all repos in the [Ruby RDF](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/) organization.
